## Introduction 📖


This repository contains basic C++ programming codes that demonstrate the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and more! 🤔

## OOPs Concepts 📚


- Classes and Objects: Learn about classes, objects, constructors, and destructors. 🏠
- Inheritance: Understand single inheritance, multiple inheritance, and multilevel inheritance. 👪
- Polymorphism: Explore function overloading, function overriding, and operator overloading. 🔄
- Encapsulation: Learn about data hiding and encapsulation in C++. 🔒
- Abstraction: Understand abstract classes and interfaces in C++. 📝

## Examples 💻


- Class and Object Example: A simple example of a class and object in C++. 📊
- Inheritance Example: An example of single inheritance in C++. 👨‍👩‍👧
- Polymorphism Example: An example of function overloading and function overriding in C++. 🔄

## Getting Started 🚀


1. Compile the code: Use a C++ compiler like GCC to compile the code. 💻
2. Run the code: Run the compiled code to see the output. ▶

## Features 🎯


- Object-Oriented Programming: C++ supports OOPs concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 📚
- Code Reusability: OOPs promotes code reusability and modularity. 📈
